// 1. Declare a variable called `firstName` and assign it your first name
//    as a string:

// Your code here 
let firstName = "Raul";

// 2. Declare a variable called `lastName` and assign it your last name
//    as a string:

// Your code here 
let lastName = " Saenz ";

// 3. Declare a variable called `age`:

// Your code here 
let age;

// 4. Print out the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` variables. What
//    do you expect them to be when they get printed?


// Your code here 
console.log(firstName + lastName)

// 5. Assign the `age` variable to a number:

// Your code here 
age = 42;

// 6. Print out the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` variables. What
//    do you expect them to be when they get printed?

// Your code here 
console.log(firstName + lastName + age)
